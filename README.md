<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## ABOUT THE PROJECT

This is a stock prices predictor app build in python using recurrent neural network, yahoo finance api, streamlit, pandas, etc. Data for the stocks is read into a Data frame from yahoo finance using the pandas_datareader module. The variety of the recurrent neural networks used for this project are LSTM(Long Short-Term Memory networks) which are capable of learning long-term dependencies in sequential prediction problems like the stock prices prediction. The choice of using LSTM instead of RNN came because according to [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/understanding-of-lstm-networks/) RNN fails to store information for a longer period of time. 

DISCLAIMER: This is not investing advice. I am not a proffesional who is qualified in giving any financial advice. This a preoject purely about Machine Learning using Financial data.

### BUILT WITH
Here are the main modules and tool I used for the project
* [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow)
* [Keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras)
* [Sklearn](https://github.com/topics/sklearn)
* [Google Colab](https://github.com/googlecolab)
* [Streamlit](https://github.com/streamlit)




<!-- ROADMAP -->
## ROADMAP

1. Create a prediction model for a specific stock
2. Train a model that can be used for any stock
3. Add other prediction models like [Facebook's FBProphet](https://github.com/facebook/prophet)
4. Create a Streamlit web application
5. Deploy the web application
